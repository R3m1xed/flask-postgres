This is a proof of concept.
This to connect a basic flask app to postgresql container.

If you wish to not proceed an enable https for your container, simply go to view.py and follow the comments to edit the code.

If you wish you use HTML instead of having it render directly. Changes the route in the view.py and add the html files as needed.
